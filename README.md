# model-of-multiple-cells

This repository contains the source code for the paper "Cell fusion through slime mold network dynamics" by Sheryl Hsu and Laura P. Schaposnik (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11371).

A sample video of the images generated by the code is available here: https://youtu.be/JCLBW9uzqfY.

Note that while this repository contains the code originally used in the writing of the paper, a slightly-improved version of the model is used in the Physarum Steiner Algorithm at https://github.com/sher222/Physarum-Swarm-Steiner-Algo.
